## 1. Research Design

### Research Questions

**Primary Question:**
> Why do students and young professionals abandon productivity tools within the first 14 days?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What specific moments trigger the abandonment decision?
2. What emotional factors contribute to abandonment?
3. What behavioral patterns are common across users?
4. What product design changes could prevent abandonment?

### Methodological Approach

**Qualitative Research Rationale:**
- **Exploratory nature:** Understanding "why" requires deep context
- **Emotional drivers:** Guilt, frustration, self-blame are qualitative
- **Behavioral complexity:** User journeys involve multiple touchpoints
- **Insight depth:** Need rich narratives, not just metrics

**Semi-Structured Interviews Rationale:**
- Flexibility to follow interesting threads
- Consistency across participants (core questions)
- Allows probing for emotional responses
- Captures user voice and language

### Research Philosophy

**Epistemological Stance:** Social Constructivism
- Reality is co-constructed through user narratives
- Multiple perspectives reveal patterns
- Researcher acknowledges own biases (abandoned 5+ tools myself)

**Theoretical Framework:** Behavioral Product Design
- Users are not perfectly rational (Kahneman, Tversky)
- Cognitive load theory (Sweller)
- Habit formation research (Fogg Behavior Model)

## 2. Sampling Strategy

### Target Population

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Age: 18-28 years old
- Student or young professional (0-5 years experience)
- Has tried and abandoned 2+ productivity tools
- Abandoned within past 12 months (fresh memory)

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Never used productivity tools
- Still actively using first tool tried (no abandonment experience)
- Age outside range (different life stage/tech comfort)

### Sampling Method

**Purposive Sampling (Non-Probability):**
- Goal: Maximum variation in behavior patterns
- Not seeking statistical representativeness
- Seeking theoretical saturation (themes repeat)

### Sample Size Justification

**22 Participants:**
- Industry standard for qualitative research: 15-25 interviews
- Saturation expected around interview 18-20
- Budget: 2 additional interviews for validation
- Precedent: Nielsen Norman Group recommends 20+ for pattern identification

### Recruitment Strategy

**Channels:**
1. University student groups (40% of sample)
2. LinkedIn posts in young professional networks (30%)
3. Reddit r/productivity, r/ADHD (20%)
4. Personal network referrals (10%)

**Incentive:** $10 Amazon gift card (compensation for time, not influence)

### Sample Characteristics

**Achieved Sample (N=22):**

| Demographic | Distribution |
|-------------|--------------|
| Age Range | 18-28 (Mean: 23.1) |
| Gender | 45% Female, 50% Male, 5% Non-binary |
| Occupation | 55% Student, 45% Young Professional |
| Tools Abandoned | 2-7 (Mean: 4.8) |

**Behavioral Segmentation:**

## 3. Data Collection

### Interview Protocol

**Format:** Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes (Mean: 38 minutes)  
**Method:** Video call (Zoom) or phone  
**Recording:** Audio recording with participant consent  

### Interview Guide Structure

**Phase 1: Rapport Building (5 min)**
- Introduction and consent
- "Tell me about yourself"
- "How do you currently manage tasks?"

**Phase 2: Tool History (10 min)**
- "What productivity tools have you tried?"
- "Walk me through discovering [Tool X]"
- "What was the setup experience like?"

**Phase 3: Usage & Abandonment (15 min)**
- "How did you use it in the first week?"
- "What changed after that?"
- "Can you pinpoint when you stopped using it?"
- **Emotional probing:** "How did that make you feel?"

**Phase 4: Ideal Solution (5 min)**
- "What would the perfect tool look like?"
- "What would you remove, not add?"

**Phase 5: Closing (3 min)**
- "Anything else to share?"
- "Can I follow up if needed?"

### Key Interviewing Techniques

1. **Active Listening:** Summarizing and reflecting back
2. **Probing:** "Tell me more about that," "What do you mean by..."
3. **Emotional Inquiry:** "How did that make you feel?" (not just what happened)
4. **Silence:** Comfortable pauses to let participants think
5. **Non-Leading Questions:** Avoiding "Don't you think..." phrasing

### Data Recording

**Primary:** Audio recordings (with consent)  
**Secondary:** Written notes during interview  
**Backup:** Immediate post-interview summary (memory fresh)  

**Transcription Method:**
- Automated transcription (Otter.ai)
- Manual cleaning and verification
- Verbatim transcription (including filler words for emotional context)

## 4. Data Analysis

### Analysis Framework: Thematic Analysis

**Following Braun & Clarke (2006) Six-Phase Method:**

### Phase 1: Familiarization with Data
- Read all transcripts fully (multiple times)
- Immersive engagement with data
- Note initial observations

### Phase 2: Generating Initial Codes
- Systematic coding of interesting features
- Extract meaningful statements
- Label with descriptive codes
- **Result:** 187 discrete observations

### Phase 3: Searching for Themes
- **Affinity Mapping Process:**
  1. Print each observation on sticky note (digital: Miro)
  2. Cluster by similarity
  3. Group clusters into themes
  4. Iterate on theme boundaries
  5. Name themes descriptively

**Result:** 8 major themes identified

### Phase 4: Reviewing Themes
- Check if themes work at coded extract level
- Check if themes work at entire dataset level
- Refine theme definitions
- **Validation:** Show themes to 5 participants → 100% agreement

### Phase 5: Defining and Naming Themes
- Define essence of each theme
- Determine scope and boundaries
- Create theme descriptions with supporting quotes

**Final Themes:**
1. Feature Overwhelm (82% prevalence)
2. Productivity Guilt (68%)
3. Setup Fatigue (73%)
4. Context Switching (55%)
5. Prioritization Difficulty (64%)
6. Tool Hopping Behavior (88%)
7. Social Comparison Anxiety (41%)
8. Lack of Flexibility (45%)

### Phase 6: Producing the Report
- Synthesize themes into key insights
- Provide vivid examples (quotes)
- Relate findings to research questions
- Generate actionable recommendations

### Persona Development Method

**Behavioral Clustering:**
1. Group participants by behavior patterns (not demographics)
2. Identify 3 distinct archetypes
3. Create detailed profiles:
   - Goals
   - Frustrations
   - Typical day
   - Pain points
   - Needs

**Validation:** Persona resonance test with 5 participants

### Journey Mapping Method

**Customer Journey Mapping (Adaptive Path framework):**
1. Identify stages (Discovery → Abandonment)
2. Map user actions at each stage
3. Identify emotions at each stage
4. Identify pain points
5. Map opportunities for intervention
6. Create future state journey (solution)

## 6. Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent

**Process:**
1. Explained research purpose before interview
2. Described how data would be used
3. Explained confidentiality measures
4. Obtained verbal consent (recorded)
5. Allowed opt-out without penalty

**What Participants Were Told:**
- Research is for portfolio project (not commercial use)
- Data will be anonymized
- Quotes may be used in presentation
- Can withdraw consent anytime

### Confidentiality & Anonymity

**Measures Taken:**
1. **Anonymization:**
   - Removed all names (participants assigned IDs: P001-P022)
   - Removed identifying details (company names, specific locations)
   - Changed minor details if too identifying

2. **Data Security:**
   - Recordings stored on encrypted drive
   - Access limited to researcher only
   - Will be deleted after project completion (6 months)

3. **Public Presentation:**
   - Only anonymized quotes used
   - No demographic details that could identify individuals
   - No photos or videos of participants

### Participant Well-being

**Emotional Safety:**
- Allowed participants to skip questions
- Checked in if participant seemed upset
- Offered to stop interview if needed
- Provided resources (therapy referrals) if discussion triggered distress

**No Deception:**
- Honest about research purpose
- No hidden cameras or secret recording
- Clear about how data would be used

### Compensation Ethics

**$10 Amazon Gift Card:**
- Compensates for time (45 min × $13/hour ≈ $10)
- Not large enough to unduly influence participation
- Paid regardless of interview completion

## 7. Limitations

### Methodological Limitations

1. **Self-Reported Data**
   - Limitation: Relies on memory and self-awareness
   - Mitigation: Asked for specific examples, probed for details
   - Impact: Some details may be inaccurate or rationalized

2. **Retrospective Reporting**
   - Limitation: Participants reporting past events (2-12 months ago)
   - Mitigation: Focused on memorable moments (first use, abandonment)
   - Impact: Fine details may be lost, but major patterns reliable

3. **Social Desirability Bias**
   - Limitation: Participants may present themselves favorably
   - Mitigation: Emphasized no right/wrong answers, created safe space
   - Impact: Minimal (participants openly admitted "failures")

4. **Researcher Bias**
   - Limitation: I've also abandoned tools (confirmation bias risk)
   - Mitigation: Reflexive journaling, peer debriefing, sought disconfirming evidence
   - Impact: Acknowledged, managed through transparency

### Sampling Limitations

1. **Non-Probability Sample**
   - Cannot generalize to entire population
   - Findings apply to: Urban, tech-comfortable, 18-28, already interested in productivity

2. **Survivor Bias**
   - Interviewed people who abandoned tools (not current successful users)
   - Missing perspective: "What makes people stick with tools?"
   - Mitigation: Specifically asked "what would make you stick?"

3. **Cultural Context**
   - Primarily English-speaking, Western cultural context
   - Productivity culture may differ in other cultures
   - Findings may not transfer globally

### Scope Limitations

1. **Timeframe**
   - 6-week project timeline
   - Could not conduct longitudinal follow-up
   - Could not validate solution with prototype

2. **No Quantitative Validation**
   - Findings are qualitative only
   - Would benefit from survey validation (N=200+)
   - Cannot claim statistical significance

3. **No Behavioral Observation**
   - Relied on self-report, not actual behavior observation
   - Could not observe users trying to use tools in real-time
   - Screen recording studies would add valuable data

### Implications for Interpretation

**What This Research CAN Claim:**
✅ Themes and patterns among 22 users who abandoned tools  
✅ Emotional drivers and behavioral patterns  
✅ Potential design opportunities  
✅ Hypotheses to be tested  

**What This Research CANNOT Claim:**
❌ Statistical prevalence across all users  
❌ Causation (only correlation/association)  
❌ That solution will definitely work  
❌ Generalization to all demographics
