**Total Duration:** 6 weeks  

---

## Week 1: Project Scoping & Research Design (Nov 1-7, 2025)

### Day 1 (Nov 1): Problem Identification
**Objective:** Identify a meaningful problem for portfolio project

**Activities:**
- Brainstormed potential problem areas: food delivery, productivity tools, local services, job search
- Reflected on personal frustrations with productivity tools (Notion, Todoist, Trello)
- Validated problem significance by researching industry abandonment rates
- **Decision:** Focus on productivity tool abandonment in first 14 days

**Insights:**
- Industry baseline: ~82% overall abandonment, 18% Day-14 retention
- Personal experience: Abandoned 5+ tools myself
- Market size: $100B+ productivity tools market

**Next Steps:** Design research methodology

---

### Day 2-3 (Nov 2-3): Research Methodology Design
**Objective:** Create rigorous research plan

**Activities:**
- Designed interview guide (semi-structured, 30-45 min)
- Identified research questions:
  - Why do users abandon?
  - What specific moments trigger abandonment?
  - What emotional factors drive the decision?
- Planned participant recruitment strategy
- Determined sample size: 22 interviews (enough for saturation)

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ Qualitative over quantitative (need deep understanding, not just metrics)
- ✅ Behavioral segmentation (not demographic)
- ✅ Focus on emotional drivers (not just functional failures)

**Artifacts Created:**
- Interview script (15 questions)
- Participant screening criteria
- Research plan document

---

### Day 4-5 (Nov 4-5): Participant Recruitment
**Objective:** Recruit 22 diverse participants

**Activities:**
- Posted recruitment messages in student groups, LinkedIn, Reddit
- Screened participants (criteria: 18-28 years old, abandoned 2+ productivity tools)
- Scheduled interviews over 4-week period
- Prepared consent forms and recording setup

**Recruitment Breakdown:**
- 40% engineering/CS students (The Overwhelmed Optimizer type)
- 35% general college students (The Serial Abandoner type)
- 25% creative professionals/grad students (The Analog Holdout type)

**Challenges:**
- Initial low response rate → Added $10 Amazon gift card incentive
- Scheduling conflicts → Offered flexible evening/weekend slots

---

### Day 6-7 (Nov 6-7): Pilot Interviews
**Objective:** Test and refine interview guide

**Activities:**
- Conducted 3 pilot interviews with friends
- Refined questions based on feedback
- Adjusted interview flow (moved emotional questions earlier to build rapport)

**Key Learnings:**
- Starting with "tell me about yourself" was too cold
- Better opener: "Have you ever abandoned a productivity app? Tell me about that."
- Needed more probing questions for emotional states
- 30-45 minutes was appropriate length

**Interview Guide v2 Created** (finalized)

## Week 2-4: Data Collection (Nov 8 - Nov 28, 2025)

### Daily Interview Log

#### Week 2 (Nov 8-14): Interviews 1-6
**Pattern Emerging:** Users blame themselves, not tools

**Notable Quotes:**
- INT_001: "I'm just not disciplined enough to use these apps"
- INT_003: "Everyone else seems to have their life together with Notion"
- INT_005: "I spend 3 hours setting up, then never actually use it"

**Emotional Tone:** Self-criticism, guilt, frustration

---

#### Week 3 (Nov 15-21): Interviews 7-14
**Pattern Emerging:** Setup fatigue is universal

**Notable Observations:**
- 11/14 participants mentioned watching YouTube tutorials (2-5 hours)
- 9/14 spent 2-4 hours on initial setup
- 12/14 described feeling "overwhelmed by options"

**Insight Forming:** Complexity is the enemy, not lack of features

---

#### Week 4 (Nov 22-28): Interviews 15-22
**Pattern Emerging:** Abandonment happens in 2-week window

**Data Points:**
- Average abandonment time: 12.3 days
- 14/22 abandoned before Day 14
- 18/22 abandoned before Day 21

**Counter-Intuitive Finding:** "More features" was cited as negative, not positive

---

## Week 5: Data Analysis & Synthesis (Nov 29 - Dec 5, 2025)

### Day 1-2 (Nov 29-30): Transcription & Initial Coding

8. Lack of Flexibility (45%)

**Key Insight:** Top 3 themes (overwhelm, guilt, setup) account for abandonment

---

### Day 5 (Dec 3): Persona Development
**Objective:** Create behavioral personas

**Activities:**
- Grouped interview participants by behavior patterns (not demographics)
- Identified 3 distinct behavioral archetypes
- Created detailed persona profiles with goals, frustrations, typical day

**Personas Created:**
1. **The Overwhelmed Optimizer** (40% of sample)
   - Downloads every app, abandons in 2 weeks
   - Spends more time organizing than doing
   
2. **The Serial Abandoner** (35% of sample)
   - Enthusiastic start, guilt-driven abandonment
   - Blames self for failure
   
3. **The Analog Holdout** (25% of sample)
   - Prefers paper, tried digital, reverted
   - Values flexibility over features

**Validation:** Showed personas to 5 participants → 100% said "this is exactly me"

---

### Day 6-7 (Dec 4-5): Journey Mapping
**Objective:** Map current state and ideal future state

**Activities:**
- Created current state journey (6 stages: Discovery → Abandonment)
- Identified critical moments and pain points
- Designed future state journey (6 stages: Discovery → Long-term use)
- Mapped interventions at each stage

**Critical Moments Identified:**
- **First 5 minutes:** Empty workspace → guided onboarding
- **Day 3-5:** Reality check → Show wins, not failures
- **Day 10-14:** Abandonment window → Weekly reflection

## Week 6: Insights Synthesis & PRD Creation (Dec 6-15, 2025)

### Day 1-2 (Dec 6-7): Key Insights Development
**Objective:** Synthesize research into actionable insights

**Activities:**
- Reviewed all data (interviews, affinity map, personas, journey maps)
- Identified counter-intuitive patterns
- Quantified pain point prevalence
- Validated insights against raw data

**7 Key Insights Generated:**
1. Critical 14-day window
2. Feature paradox (less = more)
3. Guilt-driven abandonment
4. Setup fatigue prevents usage
5. First 24 hours predict success
6. Self-attribution bias
7. Context-switching needs

**Validation Method:** Each insight supported by 3+ data points

---

### Day 3 (Dec 8): Problem Statement Refinement
**Objective:** Craft precise, measurable problem statement

**Iterations:**
1. ❌ "Productivity tools are hard to use"
2. ❌ "Users abandon productivity tools"
3. ✅ "Students and young professionals abandon productivity tools within the first 14 days because initial setup complexity and task visibility creates cognitive overload and guilt, leading to 82% abandonment rate"

**Why This Works:**
- Specific user segment
- Specific timeframe (14 days)
- Root cause identified (complexity + guilt)
- Measurable (82% abandonment rate)

---

### Day 4-5 (Dec 9-10): Solution Design
**Objective:** Design solution addressing root causes

**Activities:**
- Brainstormed 20+ potential solutions
- Evaluated each against research findings
- Selected 5 core principles:
  1. < 2-minute onboarding
  2. 3-task visibility limit
  3. Progressive feature disclosure
  4. Anti-guilt design
  5. First-session success

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Constraints over freedom (prevents overwhelm)
- ✅ Progressive over complete (reduces cognitive load)
- ✅ Celebration over punishment (prevents guilt)
- ❌ Rejected: Gamification (could create guilt if missed)
- ❌ Rejected: Social features (comparison anxiety)
